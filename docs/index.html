<h3>Summary and Problem Description</h3>
    <div class="padded">
        <p>
            Our group aims to statically render realistic hair and (ideally) fur. The reflectance models are hard to simulate because hair and fur
            have complex light-scattering properties that make it difficult to emulate via ray-tracing. Hair/fur 
            also have many physical properties like thickness, length, bend radius, that make it hard to render when applying
            physics(wind, motion). We will use the Mitsuba Renderer to generate images. On top of that, we are going to use the Marschner model for rendering hair and Ling-Qi's state of the
            art fur reflectance model as our primary resources for rendering realistic hair.

        </p>
    </div>
<h3>Goals and Deliverbles</h3>
    <div class="padded">
        <p>
            For this project, we plan to deliver a series of images generated with the Mitsuba Renderer. We will first use
            the renderer to generate some basic images of a head of hair, without any advanced lighting models. Then after
            implementing the Marschner model, we will generate several images of much more realistic human hair to compare
            to the basic renderings.
        </p>
        <p>
            When working on this project, we will have to figure out how to render realistic renderings of hair. Therefore,
            We have a couple stretch goals depending on the difficulty of the hair rendering and what issues we come across.
            First, we would like to use the Linq-Qi model for fur to try to generate realistic fun renderings for animals.
            In case this is also successful, we would also like to set up some sort of interactive real time rendering demo
            using WebGL or OpenGL.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the fur rendering deliverables, we will try to generate several images of one or two animals. This process
            seems more difficult, so we may have multiple image sections showcasing our progress on the fur rendering. Then
            we would like to set up some sort of webpage using OpenGL to have a dynamic interactive rendering of our hair and/or
            fur models.
        </p>
        <p>
            At this time, it is difficult to measure the quality of our renderings using any objective methods, since it is
            more about a realistic appearance. Since we are only using one model for each render, we also can’t check for
            improved performance, since we have no baseline. Therefore, the quality of our images will be mostly subjective.
        </p>
        <p>
            With this project, we hope to address the transformation from basic hair rendering to a more complex and realistic form. 
            Therefore, we will have a few questions to address. We will have to learn how the various hair lighting algorithms work and how we will translate them into a code structure on top of the Mitsuba Renderer.
            Hopefully through this, we will be able to understand better the how light reflects off of hair, a dense group of objects, and figure out tricks to do so realistically and efficiently.
            We are also curious in the differences between rendering hair and fur, and the challanges each of those will pose.

<h3>Schedule</h3>
    <div class="padded">
        <p>
            Week 1: Familiarize ourselves with the Mitsuba renderer, find more models, resources, and read through all of
            the research papers on hair rendering
        </p>
        <p>
            Week 2: Work on implementing the Marschner model for rendering human hair.
        </p>
        <p>
            Week 3: Attempt to finish Marschner model and move on to fur rendering if possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Week 4: Finish fur rendering (if we have started) and make a dynamic fur/hair renderer in OpenGL or WebGL (if there’s still more time).
